  abstract      = {This paper presents the current state of the art on attack and defense modeling approaches that are based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAGs allow for a hierarchical decomposition of complex scenarios into simple, easily understandable and quantifiable actions. Methods based on threat trees and Bayesian networks are two well-known approaches to security modeling. However there exist more than 30 DAG-based methodologies, each having different features and goals. The objective of this survey is to present a complete overview of graphical attack and defense modeling techniques based on DAGs. This consists of summarizing the existing methodologies, comparing their features and proposing a taxonomy of the described formalisms. This article also supports the selection of an adequate modeling technique depending on user requirements.},

  abstract      = {Abstract. We introduce and give formal definitions of attack–defense trees. We argue that these trees are a simple, yet powerful tool to analyze complex security and privacy problems. Our formalization is generic in the sense that it supports different semantical approaches. We present several semantics for attack–defense trees along with usage scenarios, and we show how to evaluate attributes. 1},
